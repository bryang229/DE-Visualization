# How to get started?

 This repo uses many different python modules to get everything in place, here are the following pip installs you will need to run to use this repo!

(Note: mac uses will need to use `pip3` instead of `pip`)

```
>> pip install numpy
>> pip install pandas
>> pip install odeintw
>> pip install matplotlib
>> pip install flask 
```

After installing all needed modules you must run the `app.py` file.

Open your terminal to the folded containing this code (ex: User/Downloads/DE-Visualization/DE-Visualization/)

You can check where you are in the terminal using `pwd`, try running `ls` and you should see `app.py` as one of the outputs once you are in the right place!
